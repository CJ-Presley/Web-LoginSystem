### Activity A (i)

>## Hardware and Software within Industry Context
>
>### Hardware in Hospitality
>
>IT and Hardware in particular are very useful within many industries, especially one where  managing people is a priority, such as the hospitality industry.
>
>Many hotels utilise the basics in terms of hardware, even when refering to their digital systems, a majority of the systems are software based and can be run so long as the device itself can handle it. However, this does not mean that the hospitality industry does not utilise hardware; rather that they stick to the basics.
>
>Hotels and various other venues that host people overnight, tend to use  a mixture of survellience cameras, motion sensors, RFID Card / Chip readers and any number of various payment devices e.g. chip and pin/ contactless card readers.
>
>The combination of the survellience cameras, motion sensors and RFID Card and Chip scanners, make hotels very secure, these pieces of hardware allow for the simple monitoring of who is a guest and who is not, as well as making removing unsavory characters from the building easier.
>
>### Hardware in Tourism / Attraction
>
>Much like the IT hardware used in the hospitality industry, the hardware used in the tourism and attraction industry is rather basic in its function, with pieces of software being used to primarily manage and track the industries' services and guests.
>
>### Software in Hospitality
>
>Information Technologies (IT) in the hospitality and tourism industry is a broad term used to describe any technology that is used for managing and supporting operations within the hospitality and tourism sectors.
>
>Hotel Management systems are used in the hospitality sector in particular because they provide a centralised platform to manage all aspects of the hotel business, for reservations and check-ins to accounting and financial management. (Umiten IV, n.d.)
>
>Many hotel management systems (HMSs) can save time, money and man-power by automating tasks that would otherwise be done manually, such as bookings, check-ins/outs, inventory tracking, scheduling of employees and payment processing. (Umiten IV, 2022)
>
>Key examples of a HMSs would include: '[monday.com](https://monday.com/pricing)', '[Lodgify](https://www.lodgify.com/pricing/)' and '[Hostaway](https://www.hostaway.com/pricing/)'. (SoftwareAdvice, n.d.)
>
>### Software in Tourism / Attraction
>
>Companies like Safari AI provide a plethora of useful IT solution in the form of Crowd Counting, Real-time Occupancy Tracking, Dwell time monitoring, Live Wait/ Queue Time Tracking, Heatmapping Asset utlisation, Guest Journey Tracing and much more. (Safari AI(1), n.d.)
>
>Utilising tool like Crowd counting and Real-time occupancy tracking helps to improve the safety of the venue and allows for easier compliance with regulations, aides the venue in collecting data for possible revenue opportunities and allows for easier identification of bottlenecks and swifter adjustments to staff resources.(Safari AI(2), n.d.)
>
>The Real-time Occupancy Tracking in particular is quite useful in venues that host large numbers of people, like a Safari or Hotel; such a piece of software would allow the venue to benchmark average time of visits per guest, allow for simpler adjustments of staff resources based upon occupancy trends and the monitoring of capacity constraints.(Safari AI(3), n.d.)
>
>## Newly Emerging Technologies
>
>### Generative AI
>
>Technologies that can generate new, derived versions of content, strategies, designs and methods by learning from large repositories of original content.
(Perri, 2024)
>
>Many on the internet consider generative AI to be plagarism, or consider it to be ruining the livihood of writers, data analysts and artists all over the globe. While, all this is indeed a side effect of introducing such a new technology to an unprepared global market, the technology in and of itself is rather well liked.
>Generative AI can create images, write text, compile reports and generate data, making it a very versitile tool.
>
>### Intelligent Applications
>
>The utilisation of one or more AI to learn from external, alternative data sources. (Perri, 2024)
>
>Intelligent Applications are augmented with AI and infused with data from transactions and external sources. They learn from their interactions, improving autonomous responses over time and potentially transforming the experience of customers, users, product owners, architects and developers. (Gartner, 2023)
>
>### Synthetic Data
>
>Artifically generated data rather than data collected from real-world events. (Perri, 2024)
>
>Synthetic date is game changing in all sectors of life, it allows for predictive models to operate without the need for customers, this means trends can be predicted within a margin or error and that customer behaviours can more easily be interpretted.
>
>Synthetic data is also a great training tool, allowing for new data analysts to be trained on sythetic data means that they are not in contact with customer details, information or other such sensitive content before they are competent enough to operate with them.
>
>### Chatbots
>
>Chatbots have been an emerging hospitality technology trend for several years. Still, the importance of this option is only growing, especially as customers now demand swift answers to questions at all times of the day.
>
>AI chatbots are useful for questions that cannot be answered by a simple FAQ page, but are to mundane for a member of staff to take the time to answer.
>
>## Digital Solutions and User Needs
>
>Digital Solutions are, in our current digitally driven age, a competitive edge against potential competition, helping companies to fullfill user needs more easily.
>
> "The better you understand your users, the more likely you are to design and build a service that works well for them." - Austrilian Government DTA
>
>To meet user needs you first need to understand the target group of the digital solution.
Groups that should be considered would be:
>
>- regularly use the service.
>- may need the service in future.
>- have problems using the service.
>- work in the service, for example, call centre staff.
>- help others use the service, for example, caseworkers, legal professionals or charity workers.
>
> Ask subject experts for information about target groups.
>
>(Digital Transformation Agency, n.d.)
>
>## Industry-Specific Guidelines and Regulations
>
>### UK Compliance
>
>The EC Directive Regulations 2002 and the Companies Act 2006, state that every UK-base business must display specific information, this applies where that business is a company or sells products or services online:
>
>- Registered Business Name
>- Registeration Number (for companies and limited liability partnerships (LLPs))
>- Place of Registration (e.g., England & Wales, Scotland)(if a company or LLP).
>- Registered office adress (for companies and LLPs)
>- Geographical address of the place of business (if selling online or concluding a contract for services online)
>- VAT number (if business is VAT registered)
>- Membership details and registration numbers for any trade or professional associations that the business is a member of.
>
>Sole traders and partnerships using a business name other than their own must also include:
>
>- The names of all individuals involved in the business.
>- An address where the business can be contacted and served with legal documents.
>
>(Stephen, 2023.)
>
>### PECR and UK GDPR
>
>Requires that users of a website must have given their prior consent to the use of cookies by a website for said site to be able to access information relating to the user's device or their use of the website.
(Stephen, 2023.)
>
>### Data Protection Legistlation
>
>There are tow pieces of data protection legislation that apply in the UK. These are:
>
>- The Data Protection Act 2008 sets out the general framework for data protection law in the UK. Part 2 of th DPA 2018 implements UK GDPR. It sits alongside UK GDPR and supplements it in certain areas with additional privacy-related rules.
>- The General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). This law applies to businesses that process personal data.
>- The General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). This law applies to businesses that process personal data.
>- The General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). This law applies to businesses that process personal data.
>
>(Stephen, 2023.)
>
>### The Equality Act 2010 - Accessibility
>
>Under UK law website providers have a legal obligation not to discriminate against people with disabilities. This includes, but is not limited to:
>
>- Learning Disabilities
>- Visual Disabilities
>- Motor Disabilities
>- Cognitive Disabilities
>
>Failure to adhere to The Equality Act 2010, or TEA 2010, leaves websites, their businesses and their provider open to civil action so long as the individual can prove that they have suffered from discrimination due to its inaccessibility.
>
>TEA 2010 does not set out any requirements that a website must fullfill to ensure compliance. Thankfully, the W3C, or the World Wide Web Consortium, has provided guidance on the technical aspects of compliance, outlining ideal accessibility fixes a site can utilise to stay on the right side of the law.

### Activity A (ii)

>## Digital Solution Proposal
>
>### Introduction
>
>The Digital Solution in question, regarding the Riget Zoo Adventures, or RZA for short, is a safari-style wildlife zoo with an on-site hotel and offers educational visits.
>
>The client would prefer a digital solution that can:
>
>- Provide customers with help and information about the attractions and facilities
>- Provide materials to support educational visits
>- Allow customers to:
>   - Reserve and book tickets for the zoo
>   - Check availability and book a stay at the hotel.
>
>The potential users of the digital solution have suggested:
>
>- Account Registration; to allow customers to manage their bookings
>- Accessibility Feature; to support a wide range of users
>- A Loyalty and Rewards Scheme
>
>(T-Levels, 2024, p.3)
>
>### SDLC Model Selection
>
>To deliver upon the criteria requested by both the users and the client, the company has elected to utilise a Agile Process Model.
>
>The "Agile Process Model", or APM for short, refers to a software development approach based on iterative development. Agile methods break tasks into smaller iterations, or parts, and do not directly involve long term planning. (javatpoint, n.d.)
>
>The project scope and requirements must, however, be laid out in advance of the project or before the development process.
>
>The planned number of iterations for this project will be 5 to 10 iterations, this will allow for a sufficient amount of breaking down, and will help the development team manage their workload as efficiently as possible. (javatpoint, n.d.)
>
>![Agile Model Diagram/ Visualisation](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/software-engineering/images/software-engineering-agile-model.png)
>*(javatpoint, n.d.)*
>
>The agile model will operate through 6 phases per cycle:
>
>- Requirement Gathering
>- Design the Requirement
>- Construction/ Iteration
>- Testing / Quality Assurance (*)
>- Deployment
>- Feedback
>
>(*)Agile Testing Methods:
>
>- Scrum: (javatpoint, n.d.)
>   - agile development process focused primarily on ways to manage tasks in team-based development conditions.
>- Crystal: (javatpoint, n.d.)
>   - Chartering: Multi activities are involved in this phase such as making a development team, performing feasibility analysis, developing plans, etc.
>   - Cyclic delivery: under this, two more cycles consist, these are:
>     - Team updates the release plan.
>     - Integrated product delivers to the users.
>   - Wrap up: According to the user environment, this phase performs deployment, post-deployment.
>
>- Dynamic Software Development (DSDM): (javatpoint, n.d.)
>   - Users must be actively connected, and teams have been given the right to make decisions. The techniques used in DSDM are:
>     - Time Boxing
>     - MoSCoW Rules
>     - Prototyping
>   - The DSDM project contains seven stages:
>     - Pre-project
>     - Feasibility Study
>     - Business Study
>     - Functional Model Iteration
>     - Design and build Iteration
>     - Implementation
>     - Post-project
>- Feature Driven Development (FDD): (javatpoint, n.d.)
>   - focuses on "Designing and Building" features.
>- Lean Software Development: (javatpoint, n.d.)
>   - follows the principle "just in time production." The lean method indicates the increasing speed of software development and reducing costs.
>
>- eXtreme Programming (XP): (javatpoint, n.d.)
>   - used when customers are constantly changing demands or requirements, or when they are not sure about the system's performance.
>
>### Research Methods and Planning
>
>When gathering feedback during each iteration of the Agile Model (javatpoint, n.d.), the company has elected to advise the usage of a Mixed Approach Research Method; using aspects of both quantitative and qualitative methods.
>
>Providing a holistic approach combining and analysing the statistical data with deeper contextualised insights.
(University of Newcastle: Australia, 2024.)
>
>When carrying out the feedback gathering stage each iteration, tools such as; interviewing people, observing users and running surveys/ questionaires will be vital to gathering usable data.
>
>### Research Tools
>
>- Focus Groups
>- Experiements
>- Volunteered User Data (Cookies)
>- Forms
>- and Reviews left on site(s)
>
>### Evaluation of Competition
>
>The Competition in the Hotel/Zoo sector (refering to the Hospitality and Attraction/ Tourism Sectors) is fierce, I have compiled averages from a number of popular Zoo/Safaris/Animal Resorts that that offer hotels/lodgings either on-site or as part of a package.
>
>Double Bedroom - 1 Bed(s), 2 People;
>
>- Average per Night (without additions): **£258/ Night**
>- Average per Night (with additions): **£262.33/ Night**
>
>Double Bedroom - 2 Bed(s), 4 People;
>
>- Average per Night (without additions): **£312.50/ Night**
>- Average per Night (with additions): **£319/ Night**
>
>Standard Bedroom - 2 Bed(s), 2 People;
>
>- Average per Night (without additions): **£258/ Night**
>- Average per Night (with additions): **£262.33/ Night**
>
>King Bedroom - 1 Bed(s), 2 People;
>
>- Average per Night (without additions): **£267.67/ Night**
>- Average per Night (with additions): **£272.33/ Night**
>
>Premium Bedroom - 1 Bed(s), 2 People;
>
>- Average per Night (without additions): **£156.50/ Night**
>- Average per Night (with additions): **£163.5/ Night**
>
>he accommodation provided by RZA's competitors is fierce, but to provide a much fuller picture of what RZA would be dealing with, I have compiled not just the accommodation pricing, but also the ticket prices.
>
>Adult Ticket;
>
>- £27.71
>
>Child Ticket;
>
>- £24.44
>
>Under 3s Ticket;
>
>- £0.83
>
>Annual Pass;
>
>- Adult: £91.67
>- Child: £66.50
>
>Ride Ticket;
>
>- Adult: £12
>- Child: £24.50
>
>Additionally out of all the reviewed comperitors almost all of them offer some form of educational experiences/ resources.
>
>## KPIs / User Acceptance Criteria
>
>### Key Performance Indicators
>
>1. The length of time per iteration (refering to: (javatpoint, n.d.)) reflecting on the practices that the development team are carrying out or the other potential bottlenecks and reduce toil.
>
>2. Code Coverage, refering to the percentage of source code properly reviewed by testing processes.
>
>3. Code Stability, refering to the number of risky changes being made to the code that code *potentially* harm the project.
>4. Sprint Burnout, refering to the narrow measure of word completed during any given sprint. Unlike [velocity](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/software-development/software-development-KPIs#cycle-time)'s reliance on averages, sprint burnout looks at the number of task completed within a given time.
>
>### User Acceptance Criteria
>
>**NOTE: the following are *potential* user acceptance criteria**
>
>1. Are customers being provided the information about attractions and facilities that they require?
>2. Are approapraite materials being provided to support educational visits?
>3. Are Customers able to reserve and book tickets for the zoo?
>4. Are customers able to check availablity and book a stay in the on-site hotel?
>5. Are accounts being registered to allow customers to manage their bookings?
>6. Are accessibility features being implemented to support a wide bearth of users?
>7. Is there loyalty/ rewards scheme in place?
>
>If the answer to any of the above is not '*yes*' then such should be implemented **appropriately** to achieve user acceptance.  
>
>## Requirements
>
>### Functional
>
>Riget Zoo Adventures(RZA) requires a system that can provide resources to users with information, approprately filtered for the user, about attractions and facilities, this system should also include a way for educational resources to be given to support educations visits from instutions such as school and college and potentially Higher Education.
>
>The System should include such features as allowing users to book, reserve and manage tickets, hotel rooms and memberships for any number of things as well as allow them to browse the availablity of any such services.
>
>### Non-Functional
>
>The system must operate smoothly, with high fidelity and image clarity, the application should be accessible to any number of users and must ultimately be secure against people looking to steal customer data from either the customers or the company.
>
>The System should, however, above all else, be reliable and not liable to break frequently in unpredicted or unfixable ways. (Altexsoft, 2022)
>
>## Justification
>
>### Risk Mitigation
>
>- Staff Acceptance: This refers to the staff's ability to adapt to a new way of working, to mitigate this it is recommended that the client provide training on similar system or on the system that will be in use to avoid potential backlash from employees.
>- Data Leaking: Refering to the risk that comes with storing user data on-site, there are 2 potential ways to mitigate this problem:
    >1. Store data on a cloud system, off-site
    >2. Keep the server in a heavily guarded section of whatever main building is selected to house it, keep it under constant security and ensure that if it is compromised that such is reported to both the GDPR and the clients whom have had their data stolen.
>- Physical damage to the hardware: this is a common issue found in many sectors, the equipment is damaged or stolen/ lost and the system is then made in accessible, a simple way to mitigate this problem is to keep up to 3 back-ups on site at all time and to have digital kill switches coded into the stolen merchandise.
